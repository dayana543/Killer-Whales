      <h1>Hunting</h1>
      <p>One of the most common ways orcas hunt is by herding fish before stunning them with tail strikes.The stunning is a result of the loud noise and physical contact of the tail and the fish. In addition, the fish are debilitated by the pressure change and turbulence which makes it easy for the orcas to catch them.As highly intelligent predators, orcas also work together in coordinated attacks to create waves that can knock prey off floating ice into the water.While a dozen orcas relentlessly attack a blue whale as it attempts to flee. The orcas' tactics include ripping off strips of flesh, ramming the flank and consuming the tongue are consistent with observed attacks on other large whales.</p>
