      <h1>Orcas in Captivity</h1>
      <p>Orcas are highly intelligent, social mammals that have long been a part of marine park entertainment, performing shows for audiences. However, it's become increasingly clear that orcas do not thrive in captivity.Whether they're born in the wild or in captivity, all orcas born have the same innate drive to swim far and dive deep. Artificial enclosures in captivity cannot offer that kind of range to orcas, contributing to boredom and stress. The stress of social disruption is compounded by the fact that orcas in captivity donâ€™t have the ability to escape conflict with other orcas, or to engage in natural swimming behaviors in pools.</p>
